## Interesting:

- Mobilizon FB event alternative in the making: https://framablog.org/2019/10/15/mobilizon-lifting-the-veil-on-the-beta-release/
- https://test.mobilizon.org/events/33e82452-6be0-4eb4-a9e2-20f85dd0aab9


## Wild Ideas:

- The great unredirecting of our time (redirects are abused for privacy violations)
- The great sign-up analysis of our time (sign-up requirements are abuse for privacy violations)
- The great un-Recaptcha-ing of our time (recaptcha's are abusive)
